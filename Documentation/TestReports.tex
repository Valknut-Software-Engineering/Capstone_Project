This project posed a few challenges with regards to a suitable testing environment. The best methodology that we found in order to properly test everything
we were working on was to use the standard white box and black box approach, while maintaining Unity as the software that will house all of the testing. Usability
testing is also another method that will be employed in the project as development progresses. Unit testing will be incorporated where possible.

	\subsection{Internal: Testing With Team Members}

	\subsubsection{White Box Testing}

	When testing occurred with members the black box and white box methods were employed at this stage. Team members would first white box test their own work in the
	Unity engine in order to determine if everything was running as expected. Considering that the majority of the projects code has some form of visual impact,
	the team member testing their own work will first have to set an outcome that they would expect once their code has been implemented into the project. They would
	then run the Unity engine and test whether their code behaves the way that they expected or intended. The code produced by each team member was uploaded to their
	GitHub branch only if it was working in their environment.

	\subsubsection{Black Box Testing}

	Once the team member's code is uploaded, they would inform the rest of the team and at least one other member would perform a pull request from their branch. That
	member will be told what the expected outcome is, thus they would test their code without knowing the inner workings of it. That individual will then run the Unity
	engine on their local machine in order to test the code thoroughly. After all checks have been passed (does it work as intended, is the functionality indeed
	correct and does the program behave as expected) they would approve the pull request to master.

	\subsection{Usibility Testing}

	Usability testing will involve gathering members with various backgrounds with regards to their computer knowledge. This will allow for a thoroughly test that both
	advanced and simple features are adequately covered. The testing pool of users will range from roughly five to ten users. They will be asked to perform a set amount of
	tasks and the time taken for each individual to complete their task will be recorded. They will also be allowed to ask questions if they get stuck. These questions will
	also get recorded in order to help improve the softwareâ€™s usability (with the individuals consent). After they have completed their task we will ask them for their
	feedback and how they felt about the software experience overall. All of these results will be taken into consideration.

	\subsection{Unit Testing}

	Unit testing will be employed where possible, although this testing will be the least recurring one due to the nature of the project. It will be employed in code
	where checks need to be, for example. where object checks need to occur (if the object is NULL or not); if the object has certain properties such as an audio
	component attached to it; if images, audio, video, textures and materials are indeed detected and do fill up their corresponding data structures.

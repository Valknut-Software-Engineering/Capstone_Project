## <center> Our Project </center> ##

<center> 

Our team was tasked to create an innovative way to allow a user to be able to make their own presentations with the utilisation of virtual reality. To do this, we have used the Unity game engine to create 3D environments that also allow users to interact with any object in it. To provide as much creative freedom as possible users can spawn in their own objects, both primitive and pre-fabricated, manipulate those objects by changing their scale and position, as well as importing their own media (images, videos and audio) into the scene. Once the user is satisfied with their presentation they can proceed to record the scene which then gets exported into a 360 degree video viewable on any device (mobile included) that has a VR player installed onto it.
